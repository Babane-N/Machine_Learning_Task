## Machine Learning Task

##### The user provides an online article link, the program will then download the article, makes it readable, prepares it for natural langauge processing, analyze and return the sentiment of the article on a scale from -1 (indicating a very strong negative sentiment) to 1 (indicating a very strong positive sentiment).

### To run this program you need following packages:

* textblob - used for the sentiment analysis.
* newspaper3k - is the library I used to get articles into my script.
